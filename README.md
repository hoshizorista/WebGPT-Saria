<h3>SarIA is a powerfull but little GPT-powered web-based assistant that has the hability to search in Google</h3>
<p>Using a simple python libraries, it quickly browses the web and checks the results and returns an intelligent summary to the user with the desired search result, as of today SarIA is capable of searching only on Google and its tied to the token limit imposed by OpenAI, however with some changes almost anything can be done</p>

<h3>Usage:</h3>
<p>Whenever you want the assistant to search for something, just type "search this:" next to the thing you want to look for. It's really simple as of today and not really overwhelming, but it provides quite a smart answer and understands the type of websites it's analyzing during the search phase. It's also able to tell you the exact issue it has in case he can't provide an answer for your search.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Installation:</h3>
<p>Just install dependencies (requirements.txt) and run the flask server afterwards.</p>

<h3>To do:</h3>
<p>The assistant still has a couple of limitations, expect in the future updates some upgrades that are still in paper:.</p>

  <li>Look multiple websites</li>
  <li>Use multiple search engines</li>
  <li>Read PDFs from websites</li>
  <li>Identify images and search them on search engines</li>
  <li>To interact with the user's pc via Macros</li>
  <li>Optimize code and responsiveness</li>
</ul>
